## What is GovCrypto? ##

`GovCrypto` was created for criminal investigations. GoyCrypto searches the target 
persons computer for evidence of the use of cryptocurrencies. GovCrypto scans the 
entire file system, including network drives, to check whether there are file name 
that indicate the use of cryptocurrencies. You can enter the search filter under 
""Settings"". If a Bitcoin-Desktop-Wallet is found, it will be selected automatically 
at the end of the scanning process. Hits can be opened with a double click. <br>
